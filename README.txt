All code included in this project was completed in 2019. I am only moving this to Github so I can host it as an
interactive website as a demonstration.

The Algorithm was taken from GeeksForGeeks.com and implemented into a JavaScript function.

This project was overseen by Professor Tao Ju of Washington University in St. Louis.

Implemented by Jason Li
